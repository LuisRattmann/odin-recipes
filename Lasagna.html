        <li>750 ml tomato passata</li>
        <li>1 tbsp broth oil for frying</li>
        <li>1/2 tbsp sugar</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Ingredients for the béchamel sauce:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>750ml milk (or 300ml milk and 200ml vegetable stock)</li>
        <li>45 grams of butter</li>
        <li>60 grams of flour</li>
        <li>lemon juice</li>
        <li>nutmeg</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <h4>Prepare the sauce:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Peel and dice 1 large onion</li>
        <li>Peel 1 clove of garlic and press through a garlic press</li>
        <li>Put some oil in a large saucepan, heat and fry the meat in it (be careful with hot oil)</li>
        <li>Add onion pieces and garlic and sauté as well</li>
        <li>Add the crushed tomatoes and 3 tablespoons of tomato paste and bring to the boil</li>
        <li>Wash a handful of basil leaves, cut into small pieces and add to the sauce</li>
        <li>Add 1/2 tablespoon sugar and 1 tablespoon broth</li>
        <li>Season with salt and pepper and let simmer for a while</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Prepare the béchamel sauce:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Melt butter in a saucepan</li>
        <li>stir in the flour in batches (beat vigorously with a whisk!)</li>
        <li>then stir in the milk in portions (note: if the sauce is still too thick, feel free to add a little more milk - the bechamel sauce must be nice and creamy at the end)</li>
        <li>add a squeeze of lemon juice, season with nutmeg, salt and pepper and mix well again</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Prepare more fillings:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Take the mozzarella out of the package and cut into small pieces</li>
        <li>Cut 500g cooked ham into pieces</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Layer the Lasagna:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 180 degrees</li>
        <li>Put a little oil on a piece of kitchen paper to rub out a large casserole dish</li>
        <li>Pour 2 scoops of the sugo into the casserole dish and spread evenly over the base with a spoon</li>
        <li>Place 1 layer of lasagne sheets on top (note: some sheets have to be broken in order to cover the entire sugo with pasta sheets)</li>
        <li>Spread another 2 scoops of sugo on the lasagne sheets</li>
        <li>Then spread about 1 tablespoon of the bechamel sauce, a few pieces of mozzarella and some ham on the sauce</li>
        <li>Always alternately layer sugo, bechamel sauce, mozzarella, ham and 1 layer of lasagne sheets in the casserole dish Tip: only use 1 ladleful of sugo in a smaller casserole dish - the ratio between pasta sheets and sugo must be right, otherwise the lasagne will be soggy</li>
        <li>The top layer of the lasagne must contain sugo, béchamel sauce and ham</li>
        <li>Finally spread enough mozzarella and 250g grated Parmesan on the lasagne</li>
        <li>Cook in the oven for about 30 minutes at 180 degrees (note: when the pasta sheets are soft, the lasagne is ready - it's best to poke it in with a fork and test)</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Serving:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the casserole dish with the lasagne on the table and spread it out on the plates</li>
        <li>If desired, serve with a green salad with olive oil and balsamic vinegar dressing</li>
    </ol>

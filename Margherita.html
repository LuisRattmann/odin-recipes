    <p>The ultimate pizza pie - pristine and simple pizza Margherita</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <h4>For the pizza dough</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ball Best Pizza Dough (or Food Processor Dough or Thin Crust Dough)</li>
        <li>Semolina flour or cornmeal, for dusting the pizza peel</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>For the pizza sauce</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 small garlic clove (1/2 medium)</li>
        <li>15 ounces crushed fire roasted tomatoes or San Marzano tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>Scant ½ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>For the toppings</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1/4 to 1/3 cup pizza sauce</li>
        <li>¾ cup shredded mozzarella cheese or 2 to 3 ounces fresh mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>Parmesan cheese, for topping</li>
        <li>Fresh basil leaves, for garnish</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Make the pizza dough:</strong> Follow the Best Pizza Dough recipe to prepare the dough (This takes about 15 minutes to make and 45 minutes to rest.)</li>
        <li>Place a pizza stone in the oven and preheat to 500°F. OR preheat your pizza oven.</li>
        <li><strong>Make the pizza sauce:</strong> ut the garlic into a few rough pieces. Place the garlic, tomatoes, olive oil, oregano and kosher salt in a blender. Blend until fully combined. (You’ll use about ⅓ cup for the pizza; reserve the remaining sauce and refrigerate for up to 1 week.)</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the cheese:</strong>f using fresh mozzarella cheese, slice it into ¼ inch thick pieces. If it’s incredibly watery fresh mozzarella (all brands vary), you may want to let it sit on a paper towel to remove moisture for about 15 minutes then dab the mozzarella with the paper towel to remove any additional moisture.
        <li><strong>Bake the pizza:</strong>When the oven is ready, dust a pizza peel with cornmeal or semolina flour. (If you don’t have a pizza peel, you can use a rimless baking sheet or the back of a rimmed baking sheet. But a pizza peel is well worth the investment!) Stretch the dough into a circle. Then gently place the dough onto the pizza peel.
        <li>Spread a thin layer of the pizza sauce over the dough, using about ¼ to ⅓ cup. Add the mozzarella cheese. Top with a thin layer of fresh grated Parmesan cheese and a few pinches of kosher salt.</li>
        <li>Use the pizza peel to carefully transfer the pizza onto the preheated pizza stone. Bake the pizza until the cheese and crust are nicely browned, about 5 to 7 minutes in the oven (or 1 minute in a pizza oven).</li>
        <li>Allow the pizza to cool for a minute or two before adding the basil on top (whole leaves, lightly torn, or thinly sliced). Slice into pieces and serve immediately.</li>
